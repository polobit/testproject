report-chart-forms.ratio-graph-desc,Ratio graph allow to compare two Tags over time. This allows you to do reports like percentage conversions from one stage to another (represented by Tags). For example&#44; if you have a 'Lead' tag for all new contacts and an 'Opportunity' tag for all qualified Opportunities&#44; a Ratio graph between these tags tells you what percentage of Leads that have come in the specified period (day/week/month)&#44; have converted into an Opportunity later. You can apply Filters for more insightful information. If you have a Filter that gives you leads from a particular source&#44; then applying the filter on the above Ratio report will tell you how many Leads coming from the particular source have converted into an opportunity.

You can apply that filter on the graph and see how leads from the source are growing.
